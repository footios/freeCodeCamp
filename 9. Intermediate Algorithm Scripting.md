## <a name="sumNum"/> Sum All Numbers in a Range]

```
   // Sum All Numbers in a Range
   // We'll pass you an array of two numbers. 
   // Return the sum of those two numbers 
   // plus the sum of all the numbers between them.
   
   // It took me 17'
   
    function sumAll(arr) {
    
      // First we sort the array. 
      // This will allow us to get the highest number in the reduce method, as second in the array. 
      let temp = [];
      temp = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

      let total = 0;
      total = temp.reduce((a, b) => {
         
        // Get all the numbers between a and b.
        let numbers = [];
        do {
          numbers.push(b--);
        } while (a <= b);

        // Calculate the sum.
        let sum = 0;
        sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
        return sum;
      })
      return total;
    }

    console.log(sumAll([10, 5]));

## <a name="difArr"/> Diff Two Arrays
```
    // Compare two arrays and return a new array with
    // any items only found in one of the two given arrays,
    // but not both. In other words, return the symmetric
    // difference of the two arrays.

    // It took me 8 hours. I was trying too hard to be smart again.
    // I tried for loop, reduce, forEach and filter
    // Then I looked at the hints and tried filter again
    
  function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
      let newArr = []
      let temp = arr1.concat(arr2);

      arr1.filter(item => {
        if (!arr2.includes(item)) {
          newArr.push(item);
        }
      })

      arr2.filter(item => {

 ## <a name="seekD"/> Seek and Destroy
```
// You will be provided with an initial array 
// (the first argument in the destroyer function), 
// followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements 
// from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.
// Note
// You have to use the arguments object.

// In 1 hour.
//I have to think very well fist.
    function destroyer(arr) {
    
      // Remove all the values
      
      let items = []
      let newArr = []
      
      // we start iterating from 1, so we skip the array.
      for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        items.push(arguments[i]);
      }

      arr.filter(j => {
        if (!items.includes(j)) {
          newArr.push(j);
        }
      })

      return newArr;
    }
    console.log('result ', destroyer([3, 5, 1, 2, 2], 2, 3, 5));
